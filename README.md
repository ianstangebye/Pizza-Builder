# NOTES
My solution uses the class 'btn-topping' to automate the adding and removal of all the toppings by using an object event target to get the id the different toppings buttons. To build the app as I wanted I had to change the name of the topping container for 'mushrooms' to singular 'mushroom'(no S) so that it would be in accordance with all the other containers. I also gave each button a value that corresponds to the index they're found at in the toppings array. Before adding the ingredients I simply check if the button clicked is cheese in which case I simply toggle the 'no-cheese class' adn update the toppings array in the order list. Otherwise, all the other buttons are the same in their adding and subtracting functions. I also created a seperate updateOrder function for ease of use.
